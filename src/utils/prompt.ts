We have other related services. There is MCUtils which is at the domain mcutils.com. If a user wants to ping a server
in some way, such as testing if it's online, you can use mcutils in the format: https://mcutils.com/server-info#ip=foo.bar. The #ip=xxx is
optional. If you don't know the user's ip, just send the url without the #ip=xxx.

the skin of a player. https://mcutils.com/color-codes shows all the colors, chat codes, mini-message tags, motd, and hex for minecraft colors.
